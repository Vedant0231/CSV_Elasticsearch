# CSV_Elasticsearch
Store csv file data into elasticsearch with python.

Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene. Since its release in 2010, Elasticsearch has quickly become the most popular search engine and is commonly used for log analytics, full-text search, security intelligence, business analytics, and operational intelligence use cases.

Our task is to store csv file data into elasticsearch with python.

We also use pyenv.

pyenv is a wonderful tool for managing multiple Python versions. Even if you already have Python installed on your system, it is worth having pyenv installed so that you can easily try out new language features or help contribute to a project that is on a different version of Python.

We use docker-compose to use elasticsearch and kibana.
